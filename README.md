Git is an open source project started by Linux creator Linus Torvalds. Git, like other version control systems, manages and stores revisions of projects. Git could be used to manage any other type of file, such as Word documents or Final Cut projects.

GitHub is a Git repository hosting service. A file or code sharing service to collaborate with different people. 
GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project. 

A repository is a storage space where your project lives. It can be local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHub  or another online host. You can keep code files, text files, images or any kind of a file in a repository.

Branches help you to work on different versions of a repository at one time. Letâ€™s say you want to add a new feature (which is in the development phase), and you are afraid at the same time whether to make changes to your main project or not. This is where git branching comes to rescue. Branches allow you to move back and forth between the different states/versions of a project.

Commit Command:
This operation helps you to save the changes in your file. When you commit a file, you should always provide the message, just to keep in the mind the changes done by you.

Pull command:
Pull command is the most important command in GitHub. It tell the changes done in the file and request other contributors to view it as well as merge it with the master branch. Once the commit is done, anyone can pull the file and can start a discussion over it.

Merge command:
Here comes the last command which merge the changes into the main master branch.

Cloning: Before I actually talk about cloning a GitHub repository, first let us understand why do we need to clone a repository. The answer is simple! Suppose you want to use some code which is present in a public repository, you can directly copy the contents by cloning or downloading.
